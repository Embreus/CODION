# CODION - COllisional Distribution of IONs

A numerical solver for the ion drift kinetic equation in magnetized plasmas, accounting for velocity space dynamics with a detailed model for Coulomb collisions. 

The model is described in detail in the MSc thesis of O. Embr√©us, <i>Ion runaway in magnetized plasmas</i> (2014), available electronically at

The script `CODION_demo_script.m` demonstrates how to specify input parameters, and calculates the time-evolution of the 2D velocity-space distribution function of deuterium in a deuterium plasma with carbon impurities, in the presence of a static electric field.
